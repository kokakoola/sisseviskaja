<h1>The Offroadcode Starter Kit</h1>
<p>A super simple starter kit, no styles, no cruft, no grids, just the actual things you need.</p>

<h2>You need to add your own&#8230;</h2>
<p>There are a couple of little bits we put placeholders in for, make sure you update the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace favicon with your own</li>
  <li>Replace apple-touch-icon with your own</li>
  <li>Update (or remove) humans.txt with your own details</li>
  <li>If you don&#8217;t need jQuery, please don&#8217;t include it!</li>
</ul>
